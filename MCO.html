<p>Last but not least, Immediately after the Movement Control Order (MCO) was announced, many lost their main source of income, especially those doing their own business. Despite the challenges, some strive to persevere. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m ain as a fresh graduate couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t agree more that our economy badly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Day by day the number of unemployment in our country increased because of our economy.  On this pandemic covid-19 our country faces difficult days ahead and I decide to do some small business " brownies cookie " to make extra money.  Alhamdulillah I received so many order and its beyond my expectation.

<p>When im in business, i‚Äôve learned a lot of things and slowly understand why feedback is important in any types of business. Customer is our priority. Positive either negative feedback we should accept that and motivate ourself to do better in the future hehe . Without criticism we never know our weakness. Bila dapat positive feedback happy dia cant be described with any words . Alhamdulillah untuk rezeki ini ‚ù§Ô∏è
